FEAMAT
---------------------------------

FEAMAT is a set of Matlab scripts for solution of PDEs on simple 2D geometries using the finite element method. The code is designed to be reasonably efficient in terms of memory and performance, but it is intended to be used mostly as a quick way to test features and methods. The usage with complex problems (involving e.g. complex geometries and/or large number of degrees of freedom) is discouraged.

INSTALLATION
---------------------------------

Run the 'addpaths.m' script to recursively add all the routines of the project.

TESTS
---------------------------------

The project is equipped with a set of tests which check the correctness of the results of most of the functions. To run all the tests, run the 'runalltests.m' script.
